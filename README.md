This repo contains program for implementing normalization function on numerical data using Spark.

<h3>DATASET:</h3>
<p>LINK: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption </p>
<p>The data is presented in a single text file, with each line representing a unique record. Each record is meticulously structured using semicolons to separate nine informative attributes:</p>

<p>Date: Captures the specific day the measurement was taken.</p>
<p>Time: Provides the time within the day for the measurement.</p>
<h3>POWER MEASUREMENTS:</h3>
<p>global_active_power: Household's overall active power usage (kilowatts) averaged over a minute.</p>
<p>global_reactive_power: Household's overall reactive power usage (kilowatts) averaged over a minute.</p>
<p>voltage: Minute-averaged voltage (volts).</p>
<p>global_intensity: Minute-averaged current intensity (amperes).</p>
<p>Sub-metering Values:
sub_metering_1, sub_metering_2, sub_metering_3: Energy consumption readings (watt-hours) from specific appliances or areas within the household (details not provided).</p>
